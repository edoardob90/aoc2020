# aoc2020

The Advent of Code, 2020 edition. The coding challenge from December 1st until Christmas created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). The first puzzles will unlock as usual at Midnight (UTC-5) on December the 1st.

This year I will team with [Giulio I.](https://github.com/giulioi) to get as close as possible to Christmas's puzzle.
