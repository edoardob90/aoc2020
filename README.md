# aoc2020

The Advent of Code, 2020 edition. The coding challenge from December 1st until Christmas created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). The first puzzles will unlock as usual at Midnight (UTC-5) on December the 1st.

This year I will team with [Giulio I.](https://github.com/giulioi) to get as close as possible to Christmas Day's puzzle.

## Languages used

We decided to find the (best) solutions to the puzzles using both Python (3.x) and the Wolfram Language.

To run the Wolfram Language scripts, the intepreter must be installed first: go [here](https://www.wolfram.com/wolframscript/), it's free. Then, a script can be run with

```
chmod +x edo.wls
./edo.wls < input.txt
```
